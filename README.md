### Why learn C?

The full title ought to be "Why learn C, when you already know a high-level language such as Python, Lua or Javascript?"

In my humble opinion, a summary may look like:

1. To learn about how the computer works
2. To harness the vast amount of available source code (see bottom)

However, more practically and closer related to my field of work - computer generated imagery in film and animation - I would distill it into: **interactive applications**. 

Primarily, to manipulate and generate:

- Geometry
- Motion
- Sound
- Images
 
### Why not X, Y or Z?

There are newer and more modern languages that accomplish the same thing in less code. Why not learn those instead? Primarily due to point 2. It's similar to learning notes for playing the Piano, even though you already have perfect pitch and can improvize. By knowing how to read others music, you can pick things up and gain inspiration that would otherwise be out of reach.

If anything, learn them all and pick the right tool for the right job.
