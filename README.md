## Learning the C family of languages

This organisation is for those interested in learning the C family of programming languages; primarily C and C++ along with interesting libraries, such as Qt and OpenGL, for use in the computer generated graphics industries like Games and Film.

#### Pre-requisities

You're assumed to have touched source-code before, be it in Python, Lua or any other higher level language. If you haven't, I recommend having a look at http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ to get you started.

#### How does this work?

We'll complete small projects, each building upon knowledge gained in previous projects.

Starting with compiling a standard "Hello, world" application in C using the OS of your choice, to getting windows up and running using Qt and graphics to show up using OpenGL and C++.

#### How can I join?

Either follow the assignments at your own pace, or join the chat-room and share insights and ask questions.

The group will progress at a steady pace, so ideally you would join early and stick with the program as by the end of it there will be less discussion involving basics and instead lean more towards advanced topics, as the group will then have acquired a sufficient amount of knowledge to venture on.

## Why learn C?

If you're wondering why you should even bother looking at C, when you already know Python, Lua, Javascript or any other high-level langauge, take a moment to read through the following articles.

- http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/14744/i-dont-know-c-and-why-should-i-learn-it
- http://www.cprogramming.com/whyc.html
- http://radar.oreilly.com/2012/06/why-learn-c.html
- http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/C_Programming/Why_learn_C%3F

Why am I doing it? Put simply, I'd like to manipulate and generate:

- Geometry
- Motion
- Sound
- Images
 
And harness the available and distilled expertise available on-line, such as these:

- [Id Software (C)](https://github.com/id-Software)
- [Unreal Editor (C++)](https://www.unrealengine.com/ue4-on-github)

### Why not X, Y or Z?

There are newer and more modern languages that accomplish the same thing in less code. Why not learn those instead? Primarily due to point 2. It's similar to learning notes for playing the Piano, even though you already have perfect pitch and can improvize. By knowing how to read others music, you can pick things up and gain inspiration that would otherwise be out of reach.

If anything, learn them all and pick the right tool for the right job.
